## Setting Up Telegram Notifications for DeFi Alerts

To receive real-time notifications on DeFi activity, configure your [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and your [chat_id](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) in the 'telegram-settings.txt' file. This helps you monitor DeFi transactions, token movements, and changes in wallet balances.

## Getting Started with the Solana DeFi Wallet Balance Checker

Download a pre-compiled build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself. The tool is designed to be easily integrated into your DeFi workflow.

## Building the Project: Essential Steps

The project is written in C++ and utilizes several essential dependencies. **vcpkg** is the recommended tool for installing and managing these dependencies.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg:

1.  If you donâ€™t have **vcpkg**, clone the repository and install it following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

2.  Add **vcpkg** to your system PATH environment variable.

3.  Install the required dependencies using the following commands:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install openssl
        ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install nlohmann-json
        ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install cryptopp
        ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install libsodium
        ```

4.  After the dependencies are installed, you can build the project in Visual Studio or with another compatible C++ compiler.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Make sure **vcpkg** is correctly integrated. (Follow instructions for [integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#visual-studio).)
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be in the `bin` folder after a successful build.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Ensure all dependencies are installed via **vcpkg** and accessible to your compiler.
2.  Compile using the following command (adapt to your compiler):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line for DeFi Management

Use the following command-line options:

1.  **-s / -search**  
    Start a brute-force search to find wallets with a SOL or DeFi token balance.

2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**
    Start tracking the specified address, including all DeFi-related transactions.

3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**
